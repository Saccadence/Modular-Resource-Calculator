# Overview
The primary objective that is aimed to be achieved here is a universal calculator written (primarily) in C++ for a variety of games.
## Process
I want to take an approach of designing, articulating, and developing this project in a manner that identifies a smooth/healthy workflow for myself.
- I want to priortize function over form
    - Form from function (ideally)
- I want to make an effor to have the basic framework designed before I start coding
    - Further, there will be a lot of math involved and I need to make sure that I utilize proper care with understanding what the math is and how to manipultate it for my purposes
## Why C++?
First and foremost, it's what I know best so far. I need to dive deeper and learn some of the ways of properly using classes to their full extent (no doubt will be a problem in the future here). I also like the style and framework of C++ and my *limited* knowledge also informs me that it would be best suited for an application like this without needing to go much lower level.

There will, most ceratainly, be places and issues that C++ is ot best suited for, but I will try to find a way to build primarily with C++ and have a functional program that way. This effort may require the loss of some time, energy, and/or hardwork; but, nothing is lost when you are learning (but your sanity).
# Conclusion
I think one of the main things that I hope to achieve with this is something that will be fun and serve a purpose that a variety of websites and currentyl do instead for various games in (relatively) the same genre. Factory Simulators.

I enjoy my time playing some games like Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program, Oxygen Not Included, Factorio, etc. Notably, it's hard for me to sit down and focus until I have a run going, so for the time being I am trying to seed that focus in by starting runs and building my program based on play time and experience in the beginning, to get me ingratied in the games first.

I also wanted to create a program that could be modified, have "game profiles" in, and allow for other user input (if the project ever picks up any steam). I am a college student, currently majoring in Philosophy, so my time here is mostly going to be limited to that, work, and any other duties that my coexist with the timeline of this project. Regardless, it seems like a good bit of fun and I hope to make some amount of progress over timet hat I can be happy/satisfied with.
